After winning the sustainability track at NC State's DiamondHacks, we researched the appâ€™s feasibility in rural areas and found internet limitations made it impractical. Instead, we used our Swift and app dev experience to create InSPIRE, a month-long program within NCSU's Women in Computer Science (WiCS). InSPIRE guides members through building real, sustainable apps beyond a weekend hackathon.
